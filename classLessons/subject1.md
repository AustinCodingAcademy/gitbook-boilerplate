## Student Learning Objective
<!-- In this section we tell the students what they will learn/practice in the lesson. Legally, we must list what the student will learn. But also, through various teaching methodologies, students will grow faster because they know where they're growing toward.  -->

*Today the student will learn and practice to understand:*

* *ObjectiveTHREE*

## Today's Checklist
<!-- This checklist should be a succinct overview of what the class day will look like. It should normally include the first three items but also the major steps of the project their completing in class today. -->

1. Daily Student Presentations
1. Whiteboard Training
1. Questions for Discussion

### Daily Student Presentation
<!-- In order to develop our students communication skills around software development, a student will plan, practice, and teach to the class on a subject listed here. The subject may be a little obscure or only slightly related to the current topic. But the second objective to these presentations is to open the minds of all the students to things we don't have enough time to cover in these short weeks with.   -->

### Whiteboard Training
<!-- Interviewing for development jobs is tough! To prepare students for the challenges ahead we will practice white boarding in-front of the class every day. Think of it as a warm-up for the project that awaits. The white boarding challenges should be taken seriously and practiced even outside of class. -->

******

#### Steps to Whiteboarding Success
<!-- Restate, rewrite, and clarify the question -->
<!-- Write the expect return given the input -->
<!-- Make a code plan and speak aloud with your interviewers/team -->
<!-- Test and come up with edge cases -->
<!-- Revise if you can for efficiency -->

### Examples
<!-- A picture, mock-up or demo of what they will build. Linking to a website in the wild would be really cool! This will give the students something to reverse engineer or setup a goal post to reach. -->

### Project Instructions
<!-- There should be clear step by step instruction that include specs for students to work at their own pace. Remember, class at ACA is intended to be used a study hall. Students should be able to work at each project with the help of a professional developer floating around the classroom. This will significantly help our students learn to program, problem-solve, and code.  -->

### Follow-up Video
<!-- The video should be a tool to help get them started and to push them further to learn more deeply about the subject. This video will come from ACA. -->

## Push Yourself Further
<!-- Provide a challenge that uses the same skill but in a different project that doesn't have step-by-step instructions. This is for the students that finish sooner and for other students to continue practicing between, during, and after each class.  -->
