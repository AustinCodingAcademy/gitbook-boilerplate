<!-- ## Prep For Your Career: TASKorHABITtoCREATE-->

<!-- ### Why it's Important -->
<!-- This section is meant to develop our student soft-skills or daily routine to make them more value to future employers. Things like books to read, apps to build, youTubers to follow, learning habits, agile approaches, etc. This is where we give them a background to the history or common practice in the industry. We must remember they have no idea how the tech world works and many haven't had a professional job before. -->

<!-- Give them the why behind the ACTION ITEM they're about to do. -->

<!-- ### Action Item -->
<!-- This is a specific task they can do NOW. It needs to be small and make them feel they are actually contributing to the their career, LinkedIn profile update, follow people on Medium, youTube, GitHub, Reddit, Hackernews, etc...  -->

<!-- ## Hear it from a Grad - TOPIC -->

<!-- ### Question: The question...? -->

<!-- As we develop our curriculum, we not only want to teach hard-skills but also soft-skill and confidence. We connect with humans and the more we use our graduates to support current students the more successful they should be in the future. As ACA grows, we should include a short video clip of a grad being asked a question about the TOPIC. This will bring to the student context to the what their doing and why its important. Again, always instilling confidence!! -->

## Subject1 Overview

<!-- In the overview, students should see the why of what they're about to learn about. This is the place for you to use metaphors or familiar everyday objects to relate the abstract computer concept to. Here is where we will tell the students the "WHY" behind what they're about to read and learn about. Then we'll give them an overview of the material, sort of a "Big Picture" of the new concept so they can go in with a context of the very NEW material.-->

### Reading - Subject1

<!-- Give them something to read in your words, as if you were talking to them about the topic. Within the reading you can link to a few articles: Medium, Wikipedia, Microsoft, CSS-Tricks, W3S, MozillaDev, etc... anything that can help give more perspective on the subject.  -->

### See It - Subject1

<!-- This should be a clear, decent quality, non-lame video that helps visually explain and teach the concept. It can come from youTube as long as it doesn't go to another code school. Eventually all video content should come from ACA. REPLACE the VIDEO PLACE HOLDER BELOW with the iframe from youTube or Vimeo-->

### Practice It - Subject1
<!-- Insert an iframe of a DotNet Fiddle, CodePen, or Repl.it with  pre-built code block(s) for the student to begin tinkering with quickly. The Code Sandbox should eventually be moved over to be owned by ACA. -->

#### Practice Section Instructions

<!-- In the sandbox above you will do x, y, z. Give the students starter instructions to get them in to the code more quickly. Remember, they're very young and you will need to guide them a little more to get them going. -->

1. In the sandbox above, StepOne

### Questions for Discussion

Students are expected to research these questions on their own and ask clarifying question during healthy back and forth with the instructor after the whiteboarding session in each class. Be sure to look these up on your own and have other questions to ask. We do not lecture in class, we discuss.
