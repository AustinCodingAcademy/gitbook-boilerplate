# JS211 Instructor Challenges

At ACA student come to class twice a week to code on a project with the guidance of the Instructor, a full-time software developer. Before class, students are to complete the Pre-Homework of each day which includes reading material, videos, practice problems, and Questions for Discussion that are to all be completed and brought to class for discussion, clarification and demonstration by the Instructor before they begin class. As the Instructor you should be familiar with the pre-homework and the expectations of the lesson.

The Pre-Homework and Class Lesson below comes from Week 2 Day 1 where students are learning about objects, arrays, and they're various methods. So far, they have learned function signatures in JavaScript, variables, ES6 syntax, data types, native methods, conditional statements and built a Rock, Paper, Scissors terminal applications. This Pig Latin game will also be a terminal application built in Node. While they have seen loops, they won't practice loops until the next class day.

Take the time now to look over the [Pre-Homework of Pig Latin](pigLatinPrep.md) and understand the expectations of the [Class Project: Pig Latin](pigLatinProject.md). When you do, create a screen recording that would demonstrate to your students how to begin building the project.

## Â¡Important! Note

You don't need to build the program, only to teach the students how to begin code planning and understanding the problems and the many task involved. This doesn't need to be a long video either, 5 - 10 minutes. This is the part of the class that you would lead the students before they begin coding in groups.
