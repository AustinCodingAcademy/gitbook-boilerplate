# WEB101 Instructor Challenges

At ACA student come to class twice a week to code on a project with the guidance of the Instructor, a full-time software developer. Before class, students are to complete the Pre-Homework of each day which includes reading material, videos, practice problems, and Questions for Discussion that are to all be completed and brought to class for discussion, clarification and demonstration by the Instructor before they begin class. As the Instructor you should be familiar with the pre-homework and the expectations of the lesson.

The Pre-Homework and Class Lesson below comes from Week 2 Day 2 where students are learning about media queries. So far, they have learned HTML semantics, CSS rules, properties and values, and various selectors. They are aware of wire framing as a concept but have only practice this once. They also know git and hosting with gitHub (though not directly tied to this particular project). This Responsive Hero Page will be their first time to make queries but already know how to link their CSS files to their HTML file.

Take the time now to look over the [Pre-Homework: Responsive Hero](responsiveHeroPrep.md) and understand the expectations of the [Class Project: Responsive Hero](responsiveHeroProject.md). When you do, create a screen recording that would demonstrate to your students how to begin building the project.

## Â¡Important! Note

You don't need to build the web pages, only to teach the students how to begin code planning and understanding the problems and the many task involved in solving it. This doesn't need to be a long video either, 5 - 10 minutes. This is the part of the class that you would lead the students before they begin coding in groups.
