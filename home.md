# Instructor Challenges

Hello! Welcome to the Instructor Candidate Challenges. Below you'll find a list of challenges corresponding to each class. Navigate to the challenge you were tasked with and read through the prompt. Excerpts of the students' textbook are included with the prompts. Use the material as you see fit and create a screen recording video demonstrating how you might teach students.

The primary objective of these prompts is to see how you can relate common knowledge to help students learn programming and a syntax used to program.
